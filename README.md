# Coursework Projects

These projects were created as part of my web development coursework. They demonstrate my skills using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, PostgreSQL, and Tailwind CSS. Each project showcases different aspects of frontend and backend development, focusing on responsive design, dynamic content, and database interaction.

Feel free to explore the repositories to see how each project was built!
